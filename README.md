1. Start implementing something: a [`TokenStream'](docs/token_stream.md).
1. Solve [a very simple array problem](docs/cp/swerc2023_prac_a.md).
1. Solve [a slightly more involving problem](docs/cp/swerc2023_a.md).
1. Solve [a problem with network flow](docs/cp/swerc2023_b.md).
1. Solve [an annoying problem](docs/cp/swerc2023_c.md).
